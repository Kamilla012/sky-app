SkyApp is an application designed for astronomy enthusiasts, providing access to various information about satellites and interactive sky observation features.

## Features

- **Satellite Tracking on Map:** With an interactive map generated using the Leaflet library, users can track the current position of selected satellites. The map displays the real-time location of satellites.
- **Star Constellation Generator:** The application utilizes an API to generate individual star constellations, allowing users to explore the sky from the comfort of their homes.
- **Planet Information:** Additionally, the application retrieves information about planets from the database. By clicking on a specific planet on the interactive map or by entering the planet's name in the search bar, users receive detailed data about the selected planet.
- **Satellite Search** The application allows users to retrieve information about satellites by entering the satellite's name or country name in the search bar. All available data is fetched from our MongoDB database.
- **Blog:** (during development) - During the application's development, we plan to add a feature that enables users to add blog posts and browse existing posts. The blog will contain engaging articles related to astronomy.
- **User Authentication:** Users can measure activity time by selecting from a list of available activities. Data is stored in the database and displayed on the user profile.
